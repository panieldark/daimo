 * An OpEvent is an onchain event affecting a Daimo account. Each OpEvent
 * corresponds to an Ethereum event log. Usually--but not always--it is also
 * 1:1 with a Daimo userop.
 *
 * In the pending state, we don't have an event log yet--instead we have an
 * opHash &/or a txHash, and a future event log which we're expecting.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * - Sending from a Daimo account (Transfer log, userop)
 * - Receiving from elsewhere (Transfer log, may or may not be a userop)
 * - Registering a name (Register log, userop)
 * - Adding or removing a device (AddDevice / RemoveDevice log, userop)
 * - Creating or redeeming a Note (NoteCreated / NoteRedeemed log, userop)

/**
 * Represents a transfer of tokens from one address to another.
 *
 * There's a surprising amount of complexity to the state of a transfer.
 *
 * - Daimo transfers start out as a `PENDING` user op.
 *   The op goes thru a lifecycle of pending (bundler has accepted, but not
 *   yet onchain) to confirmed (bundle transaction onchain) to finalized
 *   (written to a finalized L1 block, and therefore guaranteed permanent).
 *
 *   For an optimistic rollup, a userop is arguably not finalized till the
 *   challenge period is up; an L2 node can be 100% certain that a given op is
 *   final after ~6 minutes (valid L2 root included in finalized L1 block) but
 *   anyone not running an L2 full node has to wait a ~week to be sure.
 *
 * - A transfer ends up `CONFIRMED`/`FINALIZED` or `FAILED` if the op reverted.
 *
 * - A transfer can come from anywhere. Non-Daimo contracts or accounts
 *   of any kind can send coins to a Daimo account. We learn about these *only*
 *   from Transfer events--the userOpHash is null.
 *
 * - Daimo transfer, by contrast, will have a userOpHash, allowing us to track
 *   them in the pending state.
 *
 * - For Daimo transfers, we show the username of the sender or recipient.
 *
 * - For others, we show an address, except for a few special ones where we can
 *   show a descriptive slug like Daimo Faucet, Coinbase, or Binance.
